### TEAM 2


During the the Deep Learning for Computer Vison course at UPC at Summer 2017, we have completed some tasks:

### TASK 1
The aim of task 1 is to create a neural network and explore its behaviour when changing parameters such as: number of layers, batch size, epochs...
In order to do that the task is composed by subtasks:
1.1 - Architecture
1.2 - Training
1.3 - Visualization

### TASK 2
Once we have selected the best configuration for our network, in task 2 we will validate it using Terrassa Buildings dataset. By doing it, we will be able to see how our network interacts with a completely different dataset.
In task 2, we have to also evaluate a model trained by ImageNet with the Terrassa Buildings dataset.

### TASK 3
Task 3 consists on fine-tunning a model trained using ImageNet, with the Terrassa Buildings dataset and validate the results with this same dataset.

### TASK 4
During task 4 we have to improve the performance of the previous network, exploring different possibilities for obtaining better results.

### TASK 5
Task 5 is an open project, we have chosen a style transfer network.
